<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator">jacoco-badge-generator</a> can be 
used in one of two ways: as a GitHub Action or as a command-line utility (e.g., such as part of a local 
build script). The jacoco-badge-generator parses a jacoco.csv from a JaCoCo coverage report, computes 
C0 and C1 coverage percentages from <a href="https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html">JaCoCo's 
Instructions and Branches counters</a>, and generates badges for one or both of these (user configurable) 
to provide an easy to read visual summary of the code coverage of your test cases. The default behavior 
directly generates the badges internally with no external calls, but the action also provides an option
to instead generate <a href="https://shields.io/endpoint">Shields JSON endpoints</a>. It supports
both the basic case of a single jacoco.csv, as well as multi-module projects in which case the action can 
produce coverage badges from the combination of the JaCoCo reports from all modules, provided that the 
individual reports are independent. It can also optionally generate a simple JSON summary report containing 
the computed coverages for easy consumption by other tools.</p>
<p>When used as a GitHub Action, the jacoco-badge-generator can also optionally be used as part of a pull-request 
check. Specifically, you can configure it to fail the workflow run if coverage decreased relative to prior run, 
and/or if coverage is below a target threshold.</p>
<p>The jacoco-badge-generator can be integrated directly into your 
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jacoco-badge-generator">CI/CD workflow within GitHub Actions</a>, 
or it can be used as a command-line utility (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/jacoco-badge-generator/">installable 
for this purpose from PyPI</a>). It is implemented in <span itemprop="programmingLanguage">Python</span>.
The <a href="https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator" itemprop="codeRepository">jacoco-badge-generator source 
code repository</a> is hosted on GitHub; and is licensed under 
the <a itemprop="license" href="https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/blob/main/LICENSE">MIT License</a>. 
Also in the GitHub repository you will find detailed instructions for 
use including several sample GitHub workflows.</p>
<p itemprop="author copyrightHolder" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">The 
jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action is developed by
<a itemprop="url mainEntityOfPage" href="https://www.cicirello.org/"><span itemprop="name">Vincent 
A. Cicirello</span></a>. It was originally implemented for my own use, but I have decided to
share it with others.</p>

<h3>Live GitHub Actions Examples</h3>
<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator">template 
repository</a> containing a simple Java project (Maven),
and several runnable example workflows demonstrating the most common use-cases.
The purpose of that repository is to enable potential new users of the
action to use it as a project starter, or to have a sample that they can fork
and experiment with before integrating into their projects.</p>
<p>You can also take a look at the following real projects that use the
action.</p>

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<p>The jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action utilizes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python 3</a> (CLI mode is 100% Python with no external dependencies);</li>
<li>GitHub Actions mode additionally utilizes the following:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://actions.cicirello.org/pyaction/">pyaction</a> Docker container,
which is a Docker container designed to support GitHub Actions development in the Python
language (also see <a href="https://github.com/cicirello/pyaction">pyaction's GitHub 
repository</a>);</li>
<li>The 
<a href="https://github.com/cicirello/python-github-action-template">cicirello/python-github-action-template</a> 
repository, a template that we maintain to assist developers getting started developing a 
GitHub Action in Python;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> since it is implemented as a 
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action">container 
action</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="https://github.blog/2020-09-01-introducing-github-container-registry/">GitHub 
Container Registry</a>, which is where we pull 
<a href="https://github.com/cicirello/pyaction/pkgs/container/pyaction">pyaction</a> from at 
runtime for faster action loading (e.g., pulling the base Docker container from GitHub while 
an action is running on a GitHub server should be faster than pulling from Docker Hub).</li>
</ul></li>

<h3>Blog Posts About the jacoco-badge-generator</h3>
<p>As the author of the jacoco-badge-generator, I occasionally post about this, and other software that I maintain
on <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV.to</a>. See <a href="https://dev.to/cicirello">my DEV.to profile</a> for a full
list of such posts. Below is a selection of blog posts specifically about the jacoco-badge-generator.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello/jacoco-coverage-badges-for-multi-module-projects-in-github-actions-ace">JaCoCo Coverage Badges for Multi-Module Projects in GitHub Actions</a>, posted on DEV on May 25, 2023.</p>
<p>This post is a tutorial on usage of the jacoco-badge-generator for multi-module projects, including both within GitHub Actions as well as with the CLI utility.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello/using-github-actions-to-build-a-java-project-with-pull-request-coverage-commenting-and-coverage-badges-50a2">Using GitHub Actions to Build a Java Project With Pull Request Coverage Commenting and Coverage Badges</a>, posted on DEV on November 9, 2022.</p>
<p>This post is a tutorial on how to use GitHub Actions for a CI/CD pipeline to build a Java project, validate tests during pull requests, generate a coverage report, including commenting coverage on pull requests and generating coverage badges.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello/the-jacoco-badge-generator-github-action-is-now-also-available-as-a-cli-tool-from-pypi-3ma0">The jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action is now also available as a CLI tool from PyPI</a>, posted on DEV on July 8, 2022.</p>
<p>This post introduces an update to the <a href="https://actions.cicirello.org/jacoco-badge-generator/">jacoco-badge-generator</a> that includes the ability to use as a command line tool,
rather than strictly as a GitHub Action. Several examples of how to use the new functionality is covered, including how
to install from PyPI.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello/jacoco-coverage-badges-pr-coverage-checks-and-pr-coverage-comments-from-github-actions-4a8f">JaCoCo coverage badges, PR coverage checks, and PR coverage comments, from GitHub Actions</a>, posted on DEV on November 29, 2021.</p>
<p>This post introduces an update to the <a href="https://actions.cicirello.org/jacoco-badge-generator/">jacoco-badge-generator</a>, which includes pull-request coverage checks.
Additionally, it provides an example workflow demonstrating how to use it in combination with the GitHub CLI
to automate commenting on pull requests with the test coverage. This workflow was a submission to the DEV/GitHub Actions
Hackathon.</p>
